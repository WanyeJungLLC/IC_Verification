# IC_Verification

This repository is for **IC verification** ‚Äî made to encourage transparency, accountability, and a little bit of fun.  

I made this so the tird muffins being meany weinies on the DFINITY Forum can donate to a good cause.  

Let's find out how many licks it takes to get to the center of this tootsie pop ‚Äî and if the team is good on their word/payment.  
I'll admit, finding the person who deserves to have the funds donated is, at best, difficult. However, if this individual (I will not name drop) chooses to finally be constructive, I want to see it through.  

To the person they find and donate to ‚Äî you‚Äôll never know me. However, don‚Äôt become a monster. Remember where you are right now ‚Äî that passion and that fuel. Don‚Äôt let the future ruin your bootyhole like it has done to the rest of us...

Lastly, in your moments of doubt, always remember: someone out there can get a big jerk like this team to donate to you. You can do it too.

# ‚úÖ IC Verification Q&A Guide  


---

## üìå Question 1: What Proposal Types Require Verification?

| Proposal Type | Description | Reference |
|---------------|-------------|-----------|
| **Canister Upgrade Proposals** | Modify core system canisters (e.g., governance, ledger, registry). Require reproducibility checks. | [Verify Proposals Guide](https://internetcomputer.org/docs/building-apps/governing-apps/nns/concepts/proposals/verify-proposals) |
| **IC OS Version Election Proposals** | Upgrade the replica software running on nodes. Require hash verification and reproducible builds. | [DFINITY Forum](https://forum.dfinity.org/t/announcements-of-ic-os-updates/50763) |
| **Node Provider & Data Center Proposals** | Add/remove node providers or data centers. Require identity document hash matching. | [Node Provider Verification](https://internetcomputer.org/docs/building-apps/governing-apps/nns/concepts/proposals/verify-proposals) |
| **Participant Management Proposals** | Update node configurations or admin roles. Require validation of submitted parameters. | [Proposal 138130](https://nns.ic0.app/proposal/?u=qoctq-giaaa-aaaaa-aaaea-cai&proposal=138130) |

---

## üîç Question 2: What Does Each Verification Do?

- **Canister Upgrade**: Confirms Wasm binary matches source code at a specific Git commit.
- **IC OS Version**: Validates upgrade image reproducibility from claimed source.
- **Node Provider**: Matches identity document hashes to ensure authenticity.
- **Participant Management**: Verifies configuration parameters against registry expectations.

Example: Proposal 138130 used `verify-hash` scripts to confirm Internet Identity upgrade integrity.

---

## üõ°Ô∏è Question 3: Why Is Verification Crucial?

| Proposal Type | Importance |
|---------------|------------|
| **Canister Upgrades** | Prevents protocol compromise and malicious code deployment. |
| **IC OS Elections** | Ensures node software is reproducible and secure. |
| **Node Provider Proposals** | Avoids onboarding fraudulent identities. |
| **Participant Management** | Maintains subnet stability and configuration integrity. |

---

## ‚úçÔ∏è Question 4: What Happens If Stakeholders Vote Without Verifying?

- **Canister Upgrades**: Risk of deploying unverified code.
- **IC OS Elections**: Nodes may run unstable or compromised software.
- **Node Provider Proposals**: Fake identities could be added.
- **Participant Management**: Misconfigured nodes could destabilize the network.

Example: A mismatched Wasm hash could pass unnoticed, leading to irreversible deployment.

---

## üß® Question 5: Are Fake/Spam Proposals Common?

- Rare due to 25 ICP submission fee.
- Verification is a critical safeguard, not redundant.
- Prevents subtle tampering and ensures proposal legitimacy.

---

## üî¢ Question 6: What Do the Hashes Mean?

| Hash Type | Purpose |
|-----------|---------|
| **SHA-256** | Verifies Wasm binaries and upgrade images. |
| **Git Commit Hash** | Identifies exact source code version. |
| **Document Hashes** | Used for identity verification in node provider proposals. |

Each hash ensures tamper-proof integrity of submitted materials.

---

## üß™ Question 7: Are There Scripts for Verification?

Yes. Examples:

```bash
# Reproducibility check for IC OS
curl --proto '=https' --tlsv1.2 -sSLO https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dfinity/ic/<commit>/gitlab-ci/tools/repro-check.sh
chmod +x repro-check.sh
./repro-check.sh -c <commit>

# Canister hash verification
./scripts/verify-hash --ii-hash <hash> --archive-hash <hash>
```

Source: [DFINITY GitHub](https://github.com/dfinity/ic)

---

## üß© Question 8: Why Aren‚Äôt Commands Separated in Proposals?

- Bundled for atomic execution.
- Current format prioritizes efficiency over clarity.
- Community feedback is pushing for modular, explicit formats.

---

## üß∞ Question 9: Why No Plug-and-Play Dapps for Hash Verification?

- Security concerns (e.g., spoofing).
- Complexity of reproducibility.
- CLI preferred for precision.

Grassroots efforts like [proposals.network](https://proposals.network) are exploring UI-based verification tools.

---

## üí∏ Question 10: Do Verifiers Get Paid?

- No formal compensation.
- Some neurons receive voting rewards.
- Organizations may fund internal verification teams.

---

## üí∞ Question 11: Are We Wasting Money on Validators?

- Validators secure the network and execute governance.
- Without verification, votes may be misused.
- Cost is justified if validators actively verify proposals.

---

## üß¨ Question 12: Technical Explanation of Hashes

- **Creation**: Generated using SHA-256 or Git commit algorithms.
- **Usage**: Verify integrity of binaries, documents, and source commits.
- **Change**: Any input change alters the hash completely.

Ensures tamper-proof reproducibility.

---

## üë• Question 13: How Many Validators Pitch In?

- Typically 3‚Äì5 active validators per proposal.
- Some rely on DFINITY or community leaders.
- Ideal: every neuron with voting power should verify.

---

## üìÑ Question 14: What‚Äôs in the Deliverable Documentation?

| Section | Purpose |
|---------|---------|
| **Proposal Summary** | Overview of the proposed change. |
| **Source Commit** | Git hash and repo link. |
| **Build Instructions** | Steps to reproduce the binary. |
| **Hash Comparison** | Expected vs. actual hash. |
| **Validation Logs** | Output of verification scripts. |

Allows independent reproduction and verification.

---

## üè¢ Question 15: Who Employs Paid Verifiers?

| Entity | Role |
|--------|------|
| **DFINITY Foundation** | Internal verification team. |
| **Internet Computer Association (ICA)** | May fund verification efforts. |
| **Community DAOs** | Occasionally fund contributors. |

Most verification is voluntary or indirectly funded.

---

## üßæ Question 16: Details on Verification Organizations

| Entity | Ownership | Management | Funding | Sustainability |
|--------|-----------|------------|---------|----------------|
| **DFINITY Foundation** | Swiss nonprofit | R&D teams | ICP treasury, grants | Internal roadmap |
| **ICA** | Community-led | Contributor board | Treasury allocations | Ecosystem support |
| **Proposals.network** | Independent devs | Maintainers | Donations, open-source | Exploring SNS launch |
| **Community Neurons** | Individual stakers | Self-managed | Voting rewards | Voluntary, not guaranteed |
